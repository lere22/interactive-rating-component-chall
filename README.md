## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Pure Javascript

### What I learned

What i learned from creating the project Interactive rating component is how to integrated not just web but with the mobile view and learned how to creating design and responsive design with css from scratch.

Also still I use basic javascript with some inspiration from other people [solutions](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions). So I'm still try to learn about the code structure and stuff.
